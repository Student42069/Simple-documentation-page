            <header>THE COURT</header>
            <p>The  court  shall  be  a  rectangle,  78 feet  (23.77 m)  long  and,  for  singles  matches,  
                27 feet  (8.23 m)  wide.  For  doubles  matches,  the  court  shall  be  36 feet  (10.97 m) 
                wide.</p>
            <p>The  court  shall  be  divided  across  the  middle by  a  net  suspended  by  a  cord  or  metal  
                cable  which  shall  pass  over  or  be  attached  to  two  net  posts  at  a  height  of  3 ½ feet 
                (1.07 m). The net shall be fully extended so that it completely fills the space between 
                the  two  net  posts  and  it  must  be  of  sufficiently  small  mesh  to  ensure  that  a  ball  
                cannot  pass  through  it.  The  height  of  the  net  shall  be  3 feet  (0.914 m)  at  the  centre,  
                where  it  shall  be  held  down  tightly  by  a  strap.  A  band  shall  cover  the  cord  or  metal  
                cable and the top of the net. The strap and band shall be completely white. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The maximum diameter of the cord or metal cable shall be 1/3 inch (0.8 cm). </li>
                <li>The maximum width of the strap shall be 2 inches (5 cm).</li>
                <li>The  band  shall  be  between  2 inches  (5 cm)  and  2½ inches  (6.35 cm)  deep  on  
                    each side. </li>

            <p>The permanent fixtures of the court include the backstops and sidestops, the 
                spectators, the stands and seats for spectators, all other fixtures around and above the 
                court,  the  chair  umpire,  line  umpires,  net  umpire  and  ball  persons  when  in  their  
                recognised positions. </p>
            <p>In a singles match played with a doubles net and singles sticks, the net posts and the 
                part of the net outside the singles sticks are permanent fixtures and are not 
                considered as net posts or part of the net.</p>

            <p>Balls, which are approved for play under the Rules of Tennis, must comply with the 
                specifications in Appendix I. </p>
            <p>The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of whether any ball or 
                prototype  complies  with  Appendix  I  or  is  otherwise  approved,  or  not  approved,  for  
                play. Such ruling may be taken on its own initiative or upon application by any party 
                with  a  bona  fide  interest  therein,  including  any  player,  equipment  manufacturer  or  
                National  Association  or  members  thereof.  Such  rulings  and  applications  shall  be  
                made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Review  and  Hearing  Procedures  of  the  
                International Tennis Federation (see Appendix XI).</p>
            <p>The event organisers must announce in advance of the event:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The number of balls for play (2, 3, 4 or 6).</li>

            <header>THE RACKET</header>
            <p>Rackets,  which  are  approved  for  play  under  the  Rules  of  Tennis,  must  comply  with  
                the specifications in Appendix II.</p>
            <p>The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of whether any racket 
                or  prototype  complies  with  Appendix  II  or  is  otherwise  approved,  or  not  approved,  
                for play. Such ruling may be undertaken on its own initiative or upon application by 
                any party with a bona fide interest therein, including any player, equipment 
                manufacturer or National Association or members thereof. Such rulings and 
                applications  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Review  and  Hearing

                    <p>Standard game</p>
                    <p>A standard game is scored as follows with the server’s score being called first:</p>
                    <p>No point  - “Love” First point  -  “15” Second point  -  “30” Third point   -  “40” Fourth point    -  “Game”</p>
                    <p>except  that  if  each  player/team  has  won  three  points,  the  score  is  “Deuce”.  
                        After  “Deuce”,  the  score  is  “Advantage”  for  the  player/team  who  wins  the  
                        next point. If that same player/team also wins the next point, that player/team 
                        wins the “Game”; if the opposing player/team wins the next point, the score is 
                        again “Deuce”. A player/team needs to win two consecutive points 
                        immediately after “Deuce” to win the “Game”.</p>

            <header>SCORE IN A SET</header>
            <p>There  are  different  methods  of  scoring  in  a  set.  The  two  main  methods  are  the  
                “Advantage  Set”  and  the  “Tie-break  Set”.  Either  method  may  be  used  provided  that  
                the  one  to  be  used  is  announced  in  advance  of  the  event.  If  the  “Tie-break  Set”  
                 6 method is to be used, it must also be announced whether the final set will be played 
                as a “Tie-break Set” or an “Advantage Set”. </p>

            <header>SCORE IN A MATCH</header>
            <p>A match can be played to the best of 3 sets (a player/team needs to win 2 sets to win 
                the  match)  or  to  the  best  of  5  sets  (a  player/team  needs  to  win  3  sets  to  win  the  
                match). </p>

            <header>SERVER AND RECEIVER</header>
            <p>The  players/teams  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net.  The  server  is  the  player  
                who puts the ball into play for the first point. The receiver is the player who is ready 
                to return the ball served by the server.</p>
            <p class="question">Case 1: Is the receiver allowed to stand outside the lines of the court?<br>Decision:  Yes.  The  receiver  may  take  any  position  inside  or  outside  the  lines  on  the  
                receiver’s side of the net.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="choice_of_ends_and_service">
            <header>CHOICE OF ENDS AND SERVICE</header>
            <p>The choice of ends and the choice to be server or receiver in the first game shall be 
                decided  by  toss  before  the  warm-up  starts.  The  player/team  who  wins  the  toss  may  
                choose:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>To  be  server  or  receiver  in  the  first  game  of  the  match,  in  which  case  the  
                    opponent(s) shall choose the end of the court for the first game of the match; or </li>
                <li>The  end  of  the  court  for  the  first  game  of  the  match,  in  which  case  the  
                    opponent(s) shall choose to be server or receiver for the first game of the match; 
                    or </li>
                <li>To require the opponent(s) to make one of the above choices.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="question">Case  1:  Do  both  players/teams  have  the  right  to  new  choices  if  the  warm-up  is  
                stopped and the players leave the court?<br>Decision:  Yes.  The  result  of  the  original  toss  stands,  but  new  choices  may  be  made  
                by both players/teams. </p>
